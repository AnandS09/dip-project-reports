\section{\textsc{Project Plan}}
\insertWideFigure{gantt-chart}{Chart showing the estimated work distribution and projected timeline}

At a high level we envision the project to be divided into two phases.
First we plan to implement a real time object tracking network in general purpose video to ensure that we get high frame rates. 
Second we want to transfer the general purpose network to the medical images database and try to replicate the tracking performance. 

\subsection{Task breakdown}

On a very high level we envision the entire project can be broken down into the following sub tasks

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {Finding general purpose object tracking dataset.}
    \item {Building neural network models for detection and tracking}
    \item {Procuring and cleaning medical image dataset}
    \item {Porting model to tracking in medical images}
    \item {Reports}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Work distribution and timeline}

We layout the projected timeline and individual responsibilities in the GANTT chart as depicted in \autoref{fig:gantt-chart}.
Since this is a two person team, most of the work will be done by both the team mates. However, at a coarse grain Anand will be invest efforts in getting the algorithm running on general purpose images, while Sharan will be responsible for handling the issues with medical image dataset.
