\subsection{Neural network based object detection and tracking}

Since the advent of deep neural network based image processing algorithms, object detection has proved to be a defacto task. 
In fact the first deep learning network , Alexnet \cite{alexnet}, became famous due to its unrivalled accuracy in object detection on Imagenet dataset~\cite{imagenet}.

Object tracking in a video has also been a popular problem to be solved using deep learning. 
This problem is solved either by breaking the problem into multiple sub problems of object detection and location tracking, as demonstrated by DeepSORT \cite{deepsort}. Or alternatively by employing recurrent networks to perform end to end deep learning based tracking \cite{rolo}. The challenge in general for these task is achieving desired frame rates in real time.

Given the importance of the problem multiple datasets have been constructed and published to help researchers develop robust tracking algorithms. 
One such dataset is TrackingNet~\cite{trackingnet} which consists of $>$ 30K video sequences, taken from open videos in YouTube to ensure diversity. 
Other popular datasets are Microsoft COCO~\cite{microsoftcoco}, the dataset for MOT challenge~\cite{motchallenge} etc.
